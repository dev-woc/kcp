# Session Check-In & Tracking System

## Overview

The Keep Pedaling Foundation app now includes a comprehensive session check-in and tracking system. This allows approved applicants to check in for their therapy sessions, and admins to track and verify all session attendance.

## Features

### For Users (Approved Applicants)

**Dashboard Check-In:**
- Once approved, users see a "Therapy Sessions" section on their dashboard
- Click "Check In" button to record session attendance
- Select session number (1-4 for the month program)
- Optionally add:
  - Therapist name
  - Session notes (how it went, reflections, etc.)
- View complete session history with timestamps

**Session History:**
- See all past check-ins
- View check-in timestamps
- See which sessions have been verified by admin
- Completion celebration when all 4 sessions are done

### For Admins

**Session Management Portal** (`/admin/sessions`):
- View all session check-ins across all users
- Statistics dashboard:
  - Total check-ins
  - Verified vs. unverified sessions
  - Number of active users
- Filter and search capabilities
- Edit session details:
  - Verify session attendance
  - Add admin notes
  - Update therapist name
- Delete invalid check-ins

**Verification Workflow:**
1. User checks in for session
2. Admin reviews check-in
3. Admin verifies session occurred
4. Admin can add notes for tracking

## Database Schema

### Session Model

```prisma
model Session {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String
  user            User     @relation(...)

  // Session details
  checkInTime     DateTime @default(now())  // When user checked in
  sessionNumber   Int      // Which session (1-4)
  notes           String?  // User notes

  // Admin tracking
  therapistName   String?  // Therapist for this session
  adminNotes      String?  // Admin notes
  verified        Boolean  @default(false)  // Admin verified

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## API Endpoints

## Use Cases

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication

- Export session data to CSV
- Email notifications for check-ins
- Therapist portal access
- Session scheduling integration
- Reminder notifications
- Program completion certificates
- Session feedback/ratings
- Multi-month program support

## Technical Implementation

**Components:**
- `SessionCheckIn` - Client component for user check-in
- Admin sessions page - Full CRUD interface

**API Routes:**
- `/api/sessions` - User operations
- `/api/admin/sessions` - Admin operations

**Database:**
- `Session` table with user relation
- Indexed on userId and checkInTime
